# Graphic Engine

This project consists on a graphic engine project with OpenGL, Assimp, GLSL and C++. Models rendered are not mine, they are from https://free3d.com/es/ , https://www.models-resource.com/ and https://sketchfab.com/

This project can be used by anyone who wants to use it for any purpose. If you want to use it, you can open the Visual Studio solution and it is configured for a x86 configuration. Just change the configuration to this if you have the x64 
configuration active by default and it is done.

This is the first version, and until now it lets you:

1.- Load 3D models and render them on the screen. I let you here one example image:

2.- It uses the Phong ilumination model to generate spot lights, point lights to render the basic diffuse, ambient and specular lighting. I let you here two examples:
