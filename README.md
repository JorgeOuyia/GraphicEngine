# Graphic Engine

This project consists on a graphic engine project with OpenGL, Assimp, GLSL and C++. Models rendered are not mine, they are from https://free3d.com/es/ and https://www.models-resource.com/

This is the first version, and until now it lets you:

1.- Load 3D models and render them on the screen. I let you here one example image
